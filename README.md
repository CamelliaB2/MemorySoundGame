## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

Here's proof that my game has audio:

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
Link I used to make text scroll across screen: 
https://www.html.am/html-codes/marquees/html-scrolling-text.cfm

Links I used to try and record:
https://www.cockos.com/licecap/
https://recordit.co/
https://giphy.com/
Microsoft Powerpoint
Windows Ctrl + G


2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

A challenge I encountered in creating this submission was the process of trying to record it and make it into a gif. I understood that one of the features that my game must have is audio when the buttons are pressed and when the game is playing clues. I have never recorded anything on my screen before. At first, I had downloaded LICEcap, but after the initial download I couldn't figure out where it was in order to open it. So I downloaded RecordIt and used that to record my game, but I soon realized that the result did not have any audio in it. After checking to see if all of my mics were enabled, I tried again, to no avail. I tried using the website GIPHY as well, and Microsoft Powerpoint, which allows you to record your screen. Nothing I produced had sound. Eventually I found out that by pressing Ctrl + G, I was able to access a sort of recording studio for my Windows 10. Using this I was finally able to get a result with audio, but soon I encountered the problem of my result being over 10MB, meaning I couldn't post it on my application or on this README.

I overcame this problem by recording two videos. The first one was a gif of my entire game, as shown above, using LICEcap, which I finally figured out how to open and use. This gif also does not have sound. I recorded the second video using my Windows 10 Ctrl + G recording studio. In order to keep the video under 10MB, I tested a couple buttons to produce their sound. Please note that all of the buttons produce sound, not just the couple I tested, and the game also produces sound when playing clues. I posted the first gif to showcase the features of my game, and the second video as proof of my game's audio.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
Some questions I have about web development:
- Who decides what the layout of the website should look like? Is it a team-based thing? Or, if selling the website to someone, is it based on what the customer wants?
- How can you use backend to your benefit when making a game like this?
- When you or your team are working on a website, who is a good person to go to for feedback?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

If I had a few more hours, I would try and make the title of my game animated. I actually did attempt to do this, but animated text requires Javascript, and while I have had prior experience with Javascript, it was for backend related things and wasn't anything too advanced. I would also make my buttons look more fancy and professional, and to also position them in a certain way. I have 7 buttons on my game, and what I would try to do is to have one button in the middle and have the rest circle that button. I would make the center button a circle shape, while the buttons around it would be oval shaped and pointed toward the center button, so the end result looks like a flower. I would also spend more time on the sound it was playing. I had a specific tune in mind, so I would continue to fiddle around with the frequencies and speed in order to mimic the tune as closely as possible. While I feel I came kind of close to the tune I wanted to play, there is still room for improvement. Also, I would of course try and fix the recording problem.
